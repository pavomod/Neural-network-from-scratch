# Neural Network

The project involves developing an Artificial Neural Network from scratch using Python, without relying on pre-existing libraries. The validation process includes selecting a hyperparameter search space and conducting a grid search. Subsequent refinements are made to assess potential improvements. Each model is validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The final model is a neural network with 4 hidden layers, configured as follows:
- (20, tanH, He)
- (30, tanH, He)
- (20, tanH, He)
- (30, tanH, He)
- (25, relu, He)
- (3, linear, uniform).
